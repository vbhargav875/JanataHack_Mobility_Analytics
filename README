This repository contains my solution to the JanataHack - Mobility Analytics Hackathon conducted by Analytics Vidhya.

The aim of the hackathon is to train a model on the given train data and predict the 'Surge_Pricing_Type' for the test data.
This is a Multi-Class Classification problem.

I have tried the following models in my Code after performing basic featuring engineering:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
SVC 
Convolutional Neural Network
